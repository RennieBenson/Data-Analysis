**Project Description:** Descriptive Analysis of City of Vancouver Building Permits Issuance Data.

**Project Title:** Understanding the Building Permit Issuance Time for different Job Types.
**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to enable the City of Vancouver to improve its building permit issuance services to customers. Here the number of ‘Elapsed days’ for Building Permit Issuance is analyzed. The ‘Elapsed days’ represent the number of days from the application submission date to the issuance of the permit date. Through this analysis, the intention is to evaluate the average permit elapsed days for the different types of jobs, identify the trends and recommend strategies to reduce the time gap.
